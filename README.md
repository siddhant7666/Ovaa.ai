# Ovaa.ai 🩺✨  
Early Detection of PCOS using Deep Learning on Ultrasound Images  

---

## 📌 About the Project  
Ovaa.ai is a deep learning–based project designed to assist in the **early detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** through ultrasound images.  
The goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform where users can upload an image and instantly know whether PCOS is detected or not.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Upload ultrasound images and get instant prediction (PCOS Detected / Not Detected).  
- Achieved **99.24% model accuracy** on the dataset.  
- Web integration for smooth user interaction.  
- Simple interface for non-technical users.
